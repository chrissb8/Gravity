Making a website is harder than I expected. I started this site with a pre-built theme and it still took much longer than I would have thought. I am mostly to blame for that of course; I'm sure that someone who knows what they are doing could have banged this site out in a few minutes. Still, I am definitely getting better at this. With a little more practice I think I would become pretty comfortable modifying an existing site. Although I think that creating a site from scratch would be significantly more difficult.
