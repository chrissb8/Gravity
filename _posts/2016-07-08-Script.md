# Abstract
The file that I used to test this script is a memo that I wrote in the Spring semester of 2016. The memo is in support of a motion for summary judgment. The case involved a potential violation of the First Amendment rights of a high school student. 

# Description of Process
Where to begin? This is a script that converts markdown files in to multiple file types. The script sets the users input file as a variable and then runs that file through the different pandoc commands and spits out PDF, ODT, DOCX, and HTMl versions of the file.
